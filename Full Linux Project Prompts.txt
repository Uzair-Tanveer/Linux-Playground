#Updating the system

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y



#Installing the Web Server

sudo apt install apache2 -y



#Customizing the Web Page

sudo nano /var/www/html/index.html

after running this prompt, it popped open the HTML file for the apache2 localhost file, that I edited with my name and "Project Demo" in the title.



#Creating a web user admin

sudo adduser webadmin
sudo usermod -aG www-data webadmin
sudo chown -R webadmin:www-data /var/www/html
sudo chmod -R 775 /var/www/html

after running this prompt, it gave me the option to give the name to the admin, their phone number, as well as setting the password for the admin user account. 



#Adding the Backup Script

su - webadmin
nano backup_web.sh

after running the second prompt, it gave me a blank terminal to write my bash file, which I added to the Repo as well.


#Automating with Cron

crontab -e
0 2 * * * /home/webadmin/backup_web.sh

This second prompt allows for the script to run daily at an allotted time, in this case it was 2am


#Enabling the basic Firewall

sudo apt install ufw -y
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
sudo ufw allow "Apache Full"
