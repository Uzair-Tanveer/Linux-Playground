# Linux-Playground

Linux Web Server & Monitoring Project

Overview
This project demonstrates my understanding of Linux system administration, web server setup, user and permission management, automation with shell scripts, monitoring tools, and basic security configuration. 
I set up a personal web server (Apache/Nginx), automated backups with a Bash script + cron jobs, configured user and group permissions, secured the system with UFW firewall, and deployed monitoring tools to track performance.
This project simulates the type of real-world tasks an IT Support / SysAdmin professional would perform in a production environment.


Technologies & Tools Used
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Linux VM)
- Web Server: Apache2 (alternative: Nginx)
- Automation: Bash scripting + Cron jobs
- Monitoring: htop, Glances, journalctl, dmesg
- Security: UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
- Version Control: GitHub


Unfortunately, the linux machine and host machine crashed after trying to edit the script file. I did automate with Cron, installing the monitoring tools, and enabling the firewall. Unfortuantely, the script crashed and I was not able to get screenshots.
I do have the code I used and will link that in the full .txt file that shows every prompt that was written to complete this project.
