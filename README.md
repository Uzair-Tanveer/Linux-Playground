# Linux-Playground

Linux Web Server & Monitoring Project

Overview
This project demonstrates my understanding of Linux system administration, web server setup, user and permission management, automation with shell scripts, monitoring tools, and basic security configuration. 
I set up a personal web server (Apache/Nginx), automated backups with a Bash script + cron jobs, configured user and group permissions, secured the system with UFW firewall, and deployed monitoring tools to track performance.
This project simulates the type of real-world tasks an IT Support / SysAdmin professional would perform in a production environment.

- Web Server: Apache2 (alternative: Nginx)
- Automation: Bash scripting + Cron jobs
